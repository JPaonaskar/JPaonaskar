## Project Highlights

### neural-bos
Using simulated denity fields to generate BOS-images showed very promissing success but was prone to overfitting.

![Results](https://github.com/JPaonaskar/JPaonaskar/blob/main/images/candle.gif)

Input, gound truth, three point gaussing, and Neural-BOS respectively

### Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS)
