My name is Josha Paonaskar (AKA *IntoTheStorm880*) and welcome to my github!
 
## Project Highlights

### Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS)
![Airflow from a Candle](https://github.com/JPaonaskar/JPaonaskar/blob/main/images/BOS.gif)

### neural-bos
Training GAN with Map dataset showed understanding of roads and their directionality. Synthetic BOS-images will be used for future training.
