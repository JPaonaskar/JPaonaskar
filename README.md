My name is Josha Paonaskar (AKA *IntoTheStorm880*) and welcome to my github!
 
## Project Highlights

### Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS)

### neural-bos
Strong success with both maps and augmented synthetic BOS dataset. Simulated flow BOS dataset will be developed and tested soon. Keep an eye out for a paper in March!
